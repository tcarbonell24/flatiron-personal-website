                        Hello! This page was made by the person named above as part of the Flatiron School's prework for the Software Engineering course. 
                    </p>


                    <p>
                        This is a basic website to showcase some of the things I've learned during the prework portion of the Flatiron School coding bootcamp It uses HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for its functionality.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The site itself is laid out using HTML and CSS for the text formatting, page color, and for the font style. The button below is coded using JavaScript. It looks like it might need something... 
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        Can you help?
                    </p>
